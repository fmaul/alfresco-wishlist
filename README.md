# Alfresco Wishlist
This is a project to [collect your ideas for Alfresco extensions](https://github.com/fmaul/alfresco-wishlist/issues), use cases, limitations and broader issues you'd like to see fixed.

Please [create new issues](https://github.com/fmaul/alfresco-wishlist/issues/new) with what you like to see in Alfresco, what kind of extensions you'd love to see or 
add questions on how to implement certain usecases. I may give suggestions on how it can be achived with 
existing Alfresco user interfaces or needs to be customized.

The general goal is to collect ideas for extensions here which can be turned into new addon projects.
